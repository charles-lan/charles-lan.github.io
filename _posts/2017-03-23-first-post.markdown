Recently, I went to the HackerNest Tech Social Meetup, where I've met with some of the local tech community of Auckland. Here I met several people, from White Hat Hackers to
Of them, one named Harvit, who has been in the tech industry for a good 10 years. He is a tech consultant.

Harvit's insight into the tech industry is that there isn't a best language to learn for the industry. It's the ability to learn how to do several tasks, and how to think through things. Even current advanced machine learning techniques are based on statistics and linear algebra that have been written on since the 1900s. It is only because statisticians started learning how to code (made especially easy through R!) did the new term "Data Scientist" start to pop up. 

I have written some scripts in Matlab, Python and C#, but am completely not familiar with building large scale apps and actually developing code.

From him, I decided that it is time to relearn programming and development from scratch, and start out from the very basic concepts. To be able to confidently run unit tests and write scalable classes and easily maintainable code.

As my goal is to have enough skills to become a freelance coder that can tackle various different tasks.

To this end, I will be trying to create a mini code project every 2 days, each on one of the following topics.

Statistics - Using R for machine learning. Visualising graphs as a UI or on a website (I heard Shiny can achieve this)

Python - General coding

Web Development - Relearning the structure of HTTP, learning front end development.

I will probably start my learning from HTML/CSS front-end, and I will learn this while setting up this very blog. Hopefully I can get a different Jekyll theme working this time in two days.

Either way, this is the start of learning all the basics again. The difference this time is that I'll be writing guides and notes as to what I have done. It is never too late to start!
